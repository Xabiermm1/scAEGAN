# scAEGAN- Unification of Single-Cell Genomics Data by Adversarial Learning of Latent Space Correspondences 
This repository contains the online data and scAEGAN code to analyze and visualize multi-omics integration analysis, and it's downstream analysis outputs. Metrics are also available for quantifying outputs quality.

# Requirements
```
tensorflow==1.14.0
keras==2.1.0
```

# Basic Usage
Training the cyclegan on latent representations can be perfomed by running

```
python cGANtrain.py
```

with given training parameters
